This repo contains the code for my talk at the Machine Learning Dublin meet-up that took place on the 27th of June, 2016.

Open the ipython notebook to checkout the code and the answer to the question: "Who Follows Trump on Twitter?"

If the URL for the dataset stopped working please let me know so I provide an alternative.
